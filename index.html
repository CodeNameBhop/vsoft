<pre>Interview with Phil Co, from <a href="http://www.interlopers.net/articles/phil-co-interview">Interlopers</a></pre>
<hr />
<pre>Phil Co is a Level designer at Valve, he has helped create some of the most memorable and iconic levels from their award winning series. He has worked on Half-life 2 episode 2,
both Left 4 Dead 1 &amp; 2, and more recently the critically acclaimed Portal 2. He is also the author of the essential guide for aspiring level
designers &ldquo;Level Design or Games: Creating Compelling Game Experiences.&rdquo;</pre>
<hr />
<h1>What is it like working at Valve?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>Working at Valve has been absolutely amazing. I&rsquo;ve been working here for 8 years, and the company never ceases to impress me. It is filled with so much talent.
I get to work with people who have created my favourite games and even people who worked on some of my favourite films. We have a flat organization where everyone
is treated equally, and we are all co-located so everyone has equal opportunities to contribute.<br /><br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/valve_office060.jpg" alt="The main lobby at the Valve office in Bellevue." width="557" height="313" /></pre>

<h2>Could you tell us what kind of PC setup you use at Valve? Do you use anything special to optimise workflow, such as a keyboard or mice with macros?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>My work station is a PC (i7, Nvidia GTX 680, 32 gigs of RAM) with Windows 7. I have a dual monitor setup where the main monitor has my editing programs and my side monitor
has extras such as mail, web browsing, or streaming competitive Dota 2 matches! I just use a mouse and keyboard. I have a Wacom tablet for when I use Maya, but that's only occasionally.
The entire station is on an adjustable height desk with wheels. The only things you need to plug in are the power strip and the network cable. At Valve, everyone uses the
same kind of desk with wheels so that we can move freely from project to project or to a different cabal room if we expand the team. I have probably moved at least one time
every year since I joined Valve.<br /><br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/desk.jpg" width="487" height="365" />
<br />My current work station.</pre>
<hr />
<h1>What is the usual workflow you follow as a level designer at Valve?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>On a typical project at Valve, the cabal (smaller subset of the team which consists of 6-8 people) works on a weekly cycle. Every Friday, we would playtest the
section of the game that we're responsible for with someone from outside the team (even outside of the company depending on how far along we are). Everything we do
during the week is focused on that Friday playtest.
On Mondays, we have meetings where we decide what the goals are for the playtest and who is responsible for each task. As a level designer, you're the owner of the
level you're working on. If you're coming up with a brand new level, then you might call a meeting to design it. If you're iterating on an existing level, then you
would work closely with the other members of your cabal to get everything you need for that level. You might have to prototype a new mechanic which would involve a
programmer, or you might have to perform an art pass of your level which would involve an artist.
</pre>
<hr />
<h1>Once production on a game has commenced, how many levels do you usually work on simultaneously?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>The amount of levels you would work on simultaneously really depends on the project. On Portal 2, I worked on several test chambers at the same time <br />(some levels were passed on to me because they had to fit into a certain section of the game).</pre>
<pre>The test chambers in Portal 2 needed to flow together because of the way the puzzles used mechanics from previous chambers and would culminate in more complex puzzles.<br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/sp_a4_intro_01.jpg" alt="" width="786" height="442" /></pre>

<pre>I worked on a few of the Excursion Funnel levels while also making Wheatley&rsquo;s failed test chambers.
Whereas, on Left 4 Dead 2, I would work on a single level on each campaign. On the Left 4 Dead series, we liked to work on campaigns as a whole until they
started to feel shippable and then we moved to the next campaign.</pre>
<hr />
<h2>How do you decide which levels to build first, do you start chronologically or do you focus on building levels that contain key story elements?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>The order of levels to work on also depends on the project. In Left 4 Dead 2, we actually started with "The Parish" campaign (the last one) and worked backwards
from there to the first campaign, "Dead Center." We knew that so many of our customers from Left 4 Dead wanted a campaign with a shopping mall, but we just weren't
sure how to fulfill that goal at the beginning of the project, so we decided to save it for last.
On Portal 2, we built test chambers based on mechanics first. We had these mechanics (the light bridge, the tractor beam, the catapult, the paint, the laser) and had
all these individual chambers that contained puzzles for them. They were all worked on simultaneously by 3 separate cabals on the team.
We had a simple text file that would put the chambers in whatever order we wanted so that we could test the whole game. We saved the very end of the game
until the end of the development cycle. I didn't start working on the final boss level until August, 2010.

<hr />
<h2>What is your initial starting point when creating a level? Does a writer give you a brief description of how they imagine the level? Do you work from an artist&rsquo;s concept? Or perhaps both?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>The initial starting point for a level is always a meeting with everyone in the cabal. Valve has several meeting rooms and they always have a whiteboard that is
covered in diagrams, sketches and notes. It's impossible to find a clean whiteboard in the whole office!
</pre>

<pre>The whiteboard drawing for the first map in Swamp Fever.<br /><br />The level designer calls a meeting in one of these rooms and starts going through what the goals of the level are. Sometimes the level needs to introduce a <br />new mechanic or a new enemy. Sometimes we need to convey a piece of the story arc. We would list these goals and start diagramming what happens in the level moment to <br />moment. A lot of the details are left up to the level designer, but we try to get the high level design of the level clear so that everyone is on the same page and we <br />can build off of each other's ideas.</pre>
<hr />
<h1>Have there been any levels you have built that were cut from their respective games?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>I have built a few levels that have been cut from the final product. The most recent one was in Portal 2. At one point in the project, Chell was going to meet another
personality core (not Wheatley). I designed a level where this core sabotaged a test chamber so that he could communicate with you privately. He opened up the chamber so
that you could talk to him in private.
We wound up keeping the idea (Wheatley prevents a door from opening so he can talk to you through an office window) but we scrapped the test chamber with the puzzle.
</pre>
<hr />
<h2>When developing gameplay how do you decide if an area should contain a certain gameplay element such as a puzzle or a combat sequence, is this decided before an area&nbsp;is built, or do you sometimes design one for an already built area?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>We might have an initial idea that we want a certain level to contain a puzzle or combat. We try to look at what comes before and after and keep in mind what we <br />think the overall pacing should be. We learn everything from playtests, however, so we might have too much of one particular gameplay and the playtester suffers from <br />fatigue. We correct this issue in multiple ways.</pre>
<pre>For example, in Episode 2, where the player gets the car on the bridge, we decided to add a combat high moment. Most of the level up to getting the car is combat <br />but with just a few enemies at a time. It was made to be sort of a funhouse of zombies. We added the building where you pop the roof panels off so that Alyx can help <br />you with the sniper rifle based on our playtesting feedback.</pre>
<pre><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/ep2_outland_060074.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /><br /><br />Adding a section with intense combat can sometimes correct the pacing in a level.</pre>
<hr />
<h2>What would you estimate is the average amount of time it takes you to complete a level from its first iteration to its completed state? Is there a level that you were able to take from an initial idea to completion relatively quickly without many major changes and iterations? Furthermore is there a level that took a particularly long <br />time to develop?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>During Left 4 Dead 2, we were getting a little behind schedule and we really wanted to create the entire game in a single year. At the time, we were working on "Dark Carnival." <br />I was working on the Fairgrounds level and my coworker, Dario, was working on the Concert level. We needed to get the Coaster map in so that we could start playtesting and <br />Dario and I split up the map. He built the roller coaster track section and I did the Tunnel of Love section.<br /><br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/l4d2_narrow01.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="416" /><br /><br />The Tunnel of Love in Dark Carnival.<br /><br />We had the whole thing ready to test in just a few days and it was very close to how we wound up shipping it. That was probably the shortest time it took to create a level. <br />The longest by far was the final boss level for Portal 2. That took me 4 months! Final boss levels are super hard to make!</pre>
<hr />
<h1>How does the artist&rsquo;s asset pipeline feed into your level design process? Is a library of modular assets created in advance of the level being built?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>We have a pretty efficient way of integrating art within the levels. The level designers create the blocked-in version of the level as quickly and simply as possible
(while still keeping in mind the setting). We use simple brushes, existing art, and sometimes even make our own models. At the same time, artists are creating style-guides
for sections of the game. The style-guides are made so that you can copy and paste elements into your map. Level designers will modify those elements based on the needs
of the level and when we move on to another level, an artist can take over the map and do a final art pass. We also will take screenshots at various points in the process
and a concept artist will do a paint-over onto the screenshot to add details, textures, and other features to really make it look beautiful.
</pre>

<hr />
<h2>The turnaround time for Left 4 Dead 2 was particularly fast, during this time you worked on 4 of the 5 campaigns that shipped with the game, what were the challenges in completing these campaigns within the given timeframe?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>On Left 4 Dead 2, we knew the gameplay that we wanted to create, but we were challenged with expanding that gameplay into unique experiences throughout the game <br />in a short amount of time. For example, we thought about all of the fantasies people have in their heads about a zombie apocalypse and one was an amusement park.</pre>
<pre>We listed all of the elements that make an amusement park iconic and unique and tried to incorporate all of those ideas into the classic Left 4 Dead model. <br />So, playing carnival games, going down the big slide, running on a roller coaster track, and holding out on concert stage were all challenging settings to fit <br />into the schedule, but we knew they would pay off in the end.<br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/c2m2_gallery_instance.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="523" /></pre>

<hr />
<h1>Levels for the original Half-life consisted mostly of brush work and few models, today hardware is much more powerful and as a result levels are increasingly becoming more model based. Do you predict an end to brush built levels in future valve games?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>I don't think brushes will be obsolete in the near future. They are just the quickest way to build levels and test gameplay. It might be true that more of the <br />final art will be models, but to get us to that stage, we need brushes.</pre>
<hr />
<h2>The visual jump between Portal and Portal 2 is huge, was it challenging recreating areas from the previous game in higher detail but still keeping the familiarity?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>Portal 2 really benefited from concept art and style-guides. All of the test chambers we designed actually looked the same (very similar to Portal 1) at some point
in the development cycle. After the puzzles were designed, we grouped the levels into sections based on mechanics. Once that was feeling good in testing, we started to
incorporate the visual differences that would establish the art style of Portal 2 and distinguish the test chambers from those in Portal 1.
Level designers could even help out other cabals by working on the art style on another part of the game than what their cabal was responsible for. So, even
though my cabal was responsible for the last section of the game, we would take test chambers from the first section and dress them up.

<hr />
<h1>Which is your favourite Valve universe to design and create levels for and why?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>Portal 2 is probably my favorite Valve universe to design levels for. The main reason is that anything goes. You can base your design on modern reality <br />or go in a completely different direction where everything is pretty crazy. Test chambers could be whatever you wanted them to be, but when you went "behind the scenes," there <br />was this realistic structure and method to the madness.<br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/demo_finale.jpg" alt="" width="766" height="431" /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behind the scenes of Portal&rsquo;s test chambers.<br /></span></pre>
<hr />
<h1>Out of all the Source Engine levels you have built, which are you the most proud of and why?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>The one level I'm most proud of is the final boss level in Portal 2. Among the level designers at Valve, we have this running joke that each one of us has a <br />duty to work on a final boss level in a game. After that, you have fulfilled your duty. It was incredibly challenging for me to try to match the ending of Portal 1.</pre>
<pre>At the time, Portal 1's ending was listed as among the best in any video game. Starting with such high expectations didn't make things easier for me. It did take <br />me a very long time (the longest I've spent on any level), but I think it turned out pretty well and it wound up being a very rewarding experience. So many members of <br />the team contributed to the end of Portal 2, and I got to work with all of them. I learned a lot.</pre>
<hr />
<h2>In the making of Portal 2 it is revealed that early in its development the game was taking a different direction, did you work on this version and if so is <br />there anything you can reveal about what the levels were like?</h2>
<hr />
<pre>Portal 2 went through many versions (including a time when there wasn't a Portal gun), so I'm not sure which version you are asking about. I can say that we cut a 
lot of the ideas we had over the course of the project and wound up putting many of those ideas back into the game in some form. At one point, there were other 
personality cores other than Wheatley who would interact with you. We cut them from the game and wound up bringing some back for the final boss fight.

There was a time when the beginning of the game was walking through a diorama of scenes where you met Cave Johnson's voice. The art style 
of these dioramas and Cave Johnson got cut and then put back in for the underground section of the game. We always felt that if we missed 
something enough, it would make its way back into the game.
</pre>
<hr />
<h1>Portal 2 had a simultaneous release on PC, Xbox 360 and Ps3 Is this something that provided any challenges whilst building and designing the levels?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>On Portal 2, we designed everything with the gameplay in mind first. There were parts we had to optimize so that it would run on all platforms, of course. <br />The most notable sections were in the underground section with the huge vistas and the existence of paint. We would sometimes replace water with bottomless pits.<br /><img src="https://valvearchive.com/archive/Other%20Files/Interviews/Text/Interlopers/2012%20Phil%20Co%20Interview/sp_return_intro.jpg" alt="" width="711" height="400" /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wheatley&rsquo;s first test chamber that he builds used to have a lot of water.<br /><br /></span>At the end of the game, when you are traveling between test chambers by tractor beams instead of elevators, we also had to make some performance compromises, 
but the overall experience stayed the same.</pre>
<hr />
<h1>You designed the epic boss fight that takes place at the end of Portal 2. Could you talk us through the development of this level?</h1>
<hr />
<pre>For the final boss level in Portal 2, we started out with just a few goals:</pre>
<pre>1. Simple enough that players would not become stuck<br />2. Incorporate multiple kinds of mechanics to give the player a sense of complexity<br />3. Have stages of progression that could change the environment<br />4. Remind players of the Portal 1 ending</pre>
<pre>For the actual battle, a concept artist named Jeremy Bennett created some images of Wheatley with iconic pieces of Aperture Science attached to him. <br />The idea was that he knew you were coming to defeat him and he wanted to protect himself in this very haphazard way. The first concept we pursued from <br />these images was Wheatley with a bunch of turrets attached onto him.</pre>
